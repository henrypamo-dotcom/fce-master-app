Python Interpreter,"The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3 on those machines where it is available.

All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list: assignments to slices are also possible, and this can even change the size of the list _1_ clear it entirely.",or,https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists

The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function's documentation string, or docstring. There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it is good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, _2_ make a habit of it.",by|so,https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions
Python Glossary: Immutable,"An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered.

Some immutable objects might contain mutable objects (e.g. a tuple containing a list). Note that being immutable is not the same _2_ having an immutable value.",as|as,https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable
Python Glossary: Argument,"A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two kinds of argument: keyword argument: an argument preceded by an identifier in a function call or passed as a value in a dictionary preceded by **. Positional argument: an argument that is not a keyword argument. Positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an argument list and/or be passed as elements of an iterable preceded by *. Arguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function body. Assignments performed in the body do not change the values of variables _1_ used in the caller.",being,https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument
