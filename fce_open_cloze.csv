Python Interpreter,"The Python interpreter is usually installed as /usr/local/bin/python3 on those machines where it is available. Putting /usr/local/bin in your Unix shell's search path makes it possible to start it _1_ typing the command 'python3' to the shell. Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. On Windows machines where you have installed Python from the Microsoft Store, the python3.11 command will be available. Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn't work, you can exit the interpreter by _2_ the following command: quit().",by|typing,https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/interpreter.html
Python Lists,"Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type. Like strings (and all other built-in sequence types), lists can be indexed and sliced. All slice operations return a new list containing the requested elements. This means that the following slice returns a shallow copy of the list: assignments to slices are also possible, and this can even change the size of the list _1_ clear it entirely.",or,https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists
Defining Functions,"We can create a function that writes the Fibonacci series to an arbitrary boundary. The keyword 'def' introduces a function definition. It must be followed _1_ the function name and the parenthesized list of formal parameters. The statements that form the body of the function start at the next line, and must be indented. The first statement of the function body can optionally be a string literal; this string literal is the function's documentation string, or docstring. There are tools which use docstrings to automatically produce online or printed documentation, or to let the user interactively browse through code; it is good practice to include docstrings in code that you write, _2_ make a habit of it.",by|so,https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions
Python Glossary: Immutable,"An object with a fixed value. Immutable objects include numbers, strings and tuples. Such an object cannot be altered. A new object has to be created if a different value has to be stored. They play an important role in places where a constant hash value is needed, for example _1_ a key in a dictionary. Some immutable objects might contain mutable objects (e.g. a tuple containing a list). Note that being immutable is not the same _2_ having an immutable value.",as|as,https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-immutable
Python Glossary: Argument,"A value passed to a function (or method) when calling the function. There are two kinds of argument: keyword argument: an argument preceded by an identifier in a function call or passed as a value in a dictionary preceded by **. Positional argument: an argument that is not a keyword argument. Positional arguments can appear at the beginning of an argument list and/or be passed as elements of an iterable preceded by *. Arguments are assigned to the named local variables in a function body. Assignments performed in the body do not change the values of variables _1_ used in the caller.",being,https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-argument
Introduction to R,"R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. It is a GNU project which is similar _1_ the S language.

However, unlike a matrix, the columns must _3_ names.",by|which|have,https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Data-frames
Vector Arithmetic,"R operates on named data structures. The simplest structure is the numeric vector, which consists _1_ an ordered collection of numbers. Vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions, in which case the operations are performed element by element. Vectors occurring in the same expression need not all be of the same length. If they are different, the value of the expression is a vector with the same length _2_ the longest vector which occurs in the expression. This is known _3_ recycling.",of|as|as,https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html#Vector-arithmetic
Bayesian Inference,"Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. Bayesian updating is particularly important in the dynamic analysis of a sequence of data. It serves _1_ a fundamental technique in statistics, distinguishing itself from frequentist inference. The key difference is that Bayesian methods treat parameters as random variables, _2_ frequentist methods treat them as fixed quantities. This approach allows for the incorporation of prior knowledge _3_ the analysis.",as|while|into,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference
Logistic Regression,"Logistic regression is a statistical model commonly used for classification tasks. Unlike linear regression, which predicts a continuous output, logistic regression predicts the probability _1_ an event occurring, typically a binary outcome like ""Yes/No"". It fits the data to a logistic curve, which is S-shaped. The output is always _2_ 0 and 1, making it perfect for estimating probabilities. This method is widely used in machine learning _3_ classify data based on historical observations.",of|between|to,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression
Multivariate Analysis,"Multivariate analysis is based on the principles of multivariate statistics, which involves observation and analysis of more than one statistical outcome variable at a time. Typically, MVA is used to address the situations where multiple measurements are made on each experimental unit and the relations among these measurements and their structures are important. A common technique is Principal Component Analysis (PCA), which reduces the dimensionality of data _1_ preserving most of the variance. It helps in visualizing complex data sets _2_ losing significant information, transforming correlated variables _3_ a smaller set of uncorrelated variables.",while|without|into,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_statistics
Markov Chains,"A Markov chain is a stochastic model describing a sequence of possible events in which the probability of each event depends _1_ on the state attained in the previous event. This property is known as the ""memoryless"" property. Markov chains have many applications as statistical models of real-world processes, such as studying cruise control systems in motor vehicles or queues of customers arriving at an airport. The changes of state of the system are called transitions, and the probabilities associated _2_ various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process involves moving _3_ one state to another within a finite number of steps.",only|with|from,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain
Hypothesis Testing,"A statistical hypothesis test is a method of statistical inference used to decide whether the data at hand sufficiently support a particular hypothesis. Hypothesis testing allows us to make probabilistic statements about population parameters. The null hypothesis, denoted _1_ H0, usually posits that there is no effect or no difference. The alternative hypothesis, H1, is what you might believe to be true or hope to prove true. The p-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, _2_ the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct. If the p-value is less than a specific significance level, usually 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis _3_ favor of the alternative.",by|under|in,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_test
Python Decorators,"In Python, a decorator is a design pattern that allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object _1_ modifying its structure. Decorators are usually called before the definition of a function you want to decorate. They are a powerful tool because they allow programmers to wrap another function in order to extend the behavior of the wrapped function, without permanently modifying it. This is possible because functions in Python are first-class objects, _2_ means they can be passed as arguments. Many developers use them for logging, enforcing access control, or instrumentation. When you see the '@' symbol above a function, you are looking _3_ a decorator in action.",without|which|at,https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator
Tidyverse in R,"The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. One of the core principles is that data should be 'tidy', where each variable is a column and each observation is a row. The pipe operator, written as %>%, allows you to chain functions together _1_ a way that is easy to read. Instead of nesting multiple function calls, you can pass the result of one function directly _2_ the next. This approach not only makes the code cleaner _3_ also reduces the likelihood of errors during complex data transformations.",in|to|but,https://www.tidyverse.org/
Deep Learning Basics,"Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with representation learning. The word 'deep' refers to the use of multiple layers in the network. Each layer transforms its input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation. In a typical neural network, neurons are organized _1_ layers. Information travels from the input layer to the output layer, passing through several hidden layers. The process of training a network involves adjusting the weights of the connections _2_ that the error between the predicted and actual output is minimized. This is usually achieved _3_ means of an algorithm called backpropagation.",into|so|by,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning
Time Series Analysis,"Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and characteristics of the data. One of the main challenges is dealing with autocorrelation, where a value at one point in time is correlated _1_ values at previous points. To handle this, statisticians often use ARIMA models, _2_ stand for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average. These models are particularly useful for forecasting future values based on historical trends. However, it is essential to ensure that the time series is stationary _3_ applying these models, as non-stationary data can lead to misleading results.",with|which|before,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series
Regularization Techniques,"In statistics and machine learning, regularization is the process of adding information in order to solve an overdetermined problem or to prevent overfitting. This is often done by adding a penalty term to the loss function. Lasso and Ridge are two common types of regularization. Lasso can lead to sparse models _1_ forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero. This effectively performs variable selection, helping to identify the most important features in a dataset. _2_ the other hand, Ridge regression shrinks the coefficients toward zero but never makes them exactly zero. Choosing between them depends _3_ whether you want to simplify the model or keep all predictors.",by|On|on,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regularization_(mathematics)
